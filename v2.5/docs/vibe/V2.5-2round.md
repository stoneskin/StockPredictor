- what I want is to predict the possibility of the stock price will go up/down more than a giving range in the giving date range in the future. please make sure the code satisfies the requirements. 
- I am fine if it always sideways for 5%, because it's not always happen, but I want to make sure the model is well trained and can capture the market regimes.
- please review the results and give me some advice on how to improve the model performance.
