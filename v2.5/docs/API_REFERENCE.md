### Response

```json
{
  "symbol": "QQQ",
  "date": "2026-02-27",
  "predictions": [
    {
      "horizon": 20,
      "threshold": 0.025,
      "prediction": "SIDEWAYS",
      "probabilities": {
        "UP": 0.0066,

        "UP_DOWN": 0.0377,
        "SIDEWAYS": 0.8679
      },
      "confidence": 0.8679
    }
  ]
}
```

### Response Explanation

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| symbol | string | The stock symbol you requested |
| date | string | Date of prediction (or latest available) |
| predictions[].horizon | int | Prediction horizon in days |
| predictions[].threshold | float | Threshold used for classification |
| **prediction** | string | **Predicted class** - UP, DOWN, UP_DOWN, or SIDEWAYS |
| **probabilities** | dict | **Class probabilities** - shows likelihood of each class |
| **confidence** | float | **Highest probability** - confidence in the prediction |

#### Class Probabilities Explained

- **UP** (0.66%): Probability that price will go up more than threshold without going down more than threshold
- **DOWN** (8.78%): Probability that price will go down more than threshold without going up more than threshold  
- **UP_DOWN** (3.77%): Probability that price will BOTH go up AND down more than threshold (volatile)
- **SIDEWAYS** (86.79%): Probability that price will stay within ±threshold (no significant movement)

#### How to Use Probabilities

```python
# Example: Get probability of significant movement (not SIDEWAYS)
prob_significant_movement = 1 - response['predictions'][0]['probabilities']['SIDEWAYS']
# In this case: 1 - 0.8679 = 0.1321 (13.21% chance of significant movement)

# Example: Get probability of UP movement
prob_up = response['predictions'][0]['probabilities']['UP']
```

## Understanding 4-Class Classification

### Class Definitions

| Class | Condition | Meaning |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **UP** | max_gain > threshold AND max_loss ≤ threshold | Price goes UP more than threshold, but doesn't go down more than threshold |
| **DOWN** | max_loss > threshold AND max_gain ≥ threshold | Price goes DOWN more than threshold, but doesn't go up more than threshold |
| **UP_DOWN** | max_gain > threshold AND max_loss > threshold | Price goes both UP and DOWN more than threshold (volatile) |
| **SIDEWAYS** | max_gain ≤ threshold AND max_loss ≥ threshold | Price stays within ±threshold (no significant movement) |

### Example: 20-day horizon, 2.5% threshold

- **UP**: In the next 20 days, QQQ goes up >2.5% but never down >2.5%
- **DOWN**: In the next 20 days, QQQ goes down >2.5% but never up >2.5%
- **UP_DOWN**: In the next 20 days, QQQ goes up >2.5% AND down >2.5%
- **SIDEWAYS**: In the next 20 days, QQQ stays within ±2.5%

## Threshold Selection Guide

| Threshold | Use Case | Difficulty |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| 0.75% (0.0075) | Ultra-sensitive, early warning | Very hard |
| 1% (0.01) | Sensitive, short-term moves | Hard to predict |
| 1.5% (0.015) | Moderate sensitivity | Moderate |
| 2.5% (0.025) | Balanced - recommended default | Moderate |
| 5% (0.05) | Significant movements only, lower noise | Easy (mostly SIDEWAYS) |

---

## Horizon Selection Guide

| Horizon | Use Case | Typical Accuracy |
|---------|----------|----------|
| 3 days | Intraday/scalping | ~45-50% |
| 5 days | Short-term trading signals | ~60-80% |
| 10 days | Medium-term signals | ~80-85% |
| 15 days | Transition to medium-term | ~85-90% |
| 20 days | Default, balanced | ~90-95% |
| 30 days | Long-term trends | ~95-98% |

## Python Example

```python
import requests

# Single prediction
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/predict",
    json={
        "symbol": "QQQ",
        "horizon": 20,
        "threshold": 0.025
    }
)

data = response.json()
pred = data['predictions'][0]

print(f"Prediction: {pred['prediction']}")
print(f"Confidence: {pred['confidence']:.1%}")
print(f"Probabilities: {pred['probabilities']}")

# Check if significant movement expected
if pred['probabilities']['SIDEWAYS'] < 0.5:
    print("⚠️ High chance of significant movement!")
else:
    print("✅ Likely to stay within threshold")
```
