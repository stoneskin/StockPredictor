# StockPredictor plans for V2.5 

## project structure clean up

1. move all old doc and code to achieve/ directory
2. create new v2.5 directory for all new version updated code and docs

## V2.5 updates
V2.5 will based on V2.0, but with following updates:
1. Change evaluation rules to the possibility of max up/down will 1%, 2.5%, 5% in 5, 10, 20, 30 days. 
    - for example, for the next 5 days, if the stock price goes up more than 1% or down more than 1% in ANY of the 5 days, then it will be considered as UP or DOWN, otherwise it will be considered as SIDEWAYS. 
    - Its possible in 5 days its up more than 1% and down more than 1%, in that case, we will consider it as UP_DOWN, but not SIDEWAYS nor UP nor DOWN.
    - Its possible in 10 days, its up/down for 1% but sideways for 2.5% and 5%, in that case, we will consider it as UP and DOWN for 1% but SIDEWAYS for 2.5% and 5%.
    - So we will have 4 different classification targets for 4 different horizons, and each target will have 4 classes (UP/DOWN/UP_Down/SIDEWAYS).
2. Add more features, such as technical indicators, sentiment analysis, etc.
3. Add more models, such as XGBoost, CatBoost, etc.
4. Add more evaluation metrics, such as precision, recall, F1-score, etc.
5. Add more market regimes, such as bull, bear, sideways, etc.
6. Add more API endpoints, such as get_prediction_by_stock, get_prediction_by_date, etc.
7. add more logging and monitoring 
    - different log folder for training ,prediction and API call.  - we need such as log the prediction results, log the model performance, etc. 
    - logging file name need to include the date and time, so that we can easily track the performance of the model over time
